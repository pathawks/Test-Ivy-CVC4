This document describes how to intall new libraries or new versions
into the repository.

Warning:
Never change existing files in the repository!
Ivy caches them on the users' machines and will not get the new versions.

There are two modes of adding libraries.

1) If the library is present in the Maven Central (http://search.maven.org/),
   you can just copy it:

   ant install -Dorganisation=<GROUPID> -Dmodule=<MODULE> -Drevision=<VERSION>

   Maven Central lists the values for the parameters.
   By default, this installs all transitive dependencies as well.
   This can be disabled by appending "-Dtransitive=false" to the ant command line.

2) If the library is not present in Maven Central, you need to download it and
   create an Ivy file for it.
   Create a new directory in "libs/" where you put the library files and
   a file "ivy.xml" in which the library is described.
   Look at the files in the other directories and at
   https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile.html
   for more information. At least the project URL and the license should be present in it.
   If you only need to add a new version of an existing library, the ivy.xml file
   usually doesn't need to be changed.
   Then call

   ./publish.sh <LIBRARY> -publishpattern "[artifact]-[revision].[ext]" -revision <VERSION>

   <LIBRARY> is the name of the directory in "lib/". This assumes that
   the JAR of the library has the file name <ARTIFACTID>-<VERSION>.jar.
   If this is not true, adjust the publish pattern. For example,
   for the Eclipse libraries the pattern "[artifact]_[revision](-[classifier]).[ext]"
   can be used.

Special scripts are available for SMTInterpol, Princess and LassoRanker.

(1) Check out SMTInterpol from https://github.com/juergenchrist/smtinterpol,
    run ant to build it, and then "./publish-smtinterpol.sh <DIR>" to add it
    to the repository.
(2) Check out Princess from svn://hal4.it.uu.se/princess/interpolation/trunk,
    create a directory "extlibs" in the root of the Princess repository and
    put the file "java-cup-11.jar" (http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/java-cup-11a.jar)
    into it. Then change to the ivy repository in the root folder and start
    the script "./publish-princess.sh <DIR/TO/PRINCESS/SVN>". After that
    everything should be finished.
(3) Check out Ultimate from https://github.com/ultimate-pa/ultimate.git and 
    then run ./publish-ultimate-lasso-ranker.sh <ultimate_dir>.


Before committing to SVN,
verify that the files in "repository/<ORGANISATION>/<MODULE>/" were added
(especially the JAR files).

Please add a reference to the new library or version to the file Libraries.txt.
If you added a library with publish.sh, please add the created ivy.xml file
to the repository as well, but not the JAR files of the library.
